# Wordle Crack

Simulating the [Wordle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle) Game im `wordlee.py` and solving it automatically in `crack_wordlee.py`.

In `run_evaluation.job` I ran the 'crack' for 100 times for every word-size from 2 to 14.

The results can be obtained by running `eval_wordlee_crack.py`. A short summary of the success-rate and mean number of tries for every length can be seen in the plots below.
